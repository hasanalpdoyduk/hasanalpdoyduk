**`Embedded Developer`**

I'm an Electrical and Electronics Engineering graduate from Turkey with a growing passion for embedded systems, both hardware and software. I've worked on a variety of real-world engineering challenges, from developing a secure bootloader for ECUs to creating sensor-driven safety devices and control systems using STM32, ESP32, and PLCs. I enjoy building complete systems end-to-end, from schematic and PCB design to firmware development, testing, and optimization. 

Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into the integration of embedded systems with AI, focusing on applications such as real-time signal processing and smart automation. My goal is to keep building systems that make a difference, grow as an engineer, and contribute to technologies that connect the digital and physical worlds, where code drives hardware, and every signal counts.
